# Resume Screening ML Project using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview
This project aims to automate the screening of resumes using machine learning, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The KNN algorithm is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks based on similarity measures.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory to store resume data.
- `models/`: Directory to store trained KNN models.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for easy setup.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
